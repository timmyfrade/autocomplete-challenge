## Autocomplete challenge for - [Klx]

## Architecture Considerations

The architecture of this challenge was organized having in mind the best practices, like file structure, type of components (class vs function components), CSS, unit tests, etc.

## Priorities

My priorities for this challenge were functionality, code quality and readability (I find this very important) and presentation. I personally like simple and clean frontend layouts, because it's easily accessible.

## How to run the project

Below are the instructions to setup this project:

-> This project was generated with React JS version 18.2.0.

## Development server
-> To start the project: Run cd autocomplete-challenge. 
-> Run npm install
-> Run npm start. [npm start] runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Build
-> [npm run build] to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the build/ directory.

## Running Unit Tests
-> Unit testing is not my strongest skill, so the test cases are limited but they pass with no problem.
-> Run npm test to execute the unit tests.
I created some rendering tests in an attempt to show my testing knowledge, but I am always eager to learn more about this subject.

Thank you very much!"# autocomplete-challenge"
